# Cat_Mat_v1  
**Authored by Benjamin Brown**  

This project is an Iot enabled, pet entertainmennt device that allows pets and their humans to stay connected throughout the day, no matter where the humans go! 
It is a *cat-aware detection system* built around a Particle Photon2, a VL53 time-of-flight distance sensor and a stepper motor...
The goal is to detect when a furry friend crosses a programmable threshold zone, then trigger an interactive response. 
Once detection occurs, the Photon2 verifies the trigger, randomly selects one of several game modes, and lights up a grid of NeoPixels to engage the cat in a playful, visual challenge.  

Designed with a focus on **non-blocking logic**, clean timing, and straightforward game selection, *Cat_Mat_v1* blends responsive sensor input with creative LED effects. 
The result is a project thatâ€™s equal parts embedded engineering exercise, feline entertainment device, and low-key LED showpiece. **Future revisions** are intended to incorporate *hardware sleep modes* and **web camera interactivity** for improved power efficiency and extended autonomous operation.
